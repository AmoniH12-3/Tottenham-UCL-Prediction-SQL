# Can Tottenham Win the 2026 UCL Final?
## Introduction
- This project uses SQL to assess whether Tottenham Hotspur can realistically win the UEFA Champions League by analyzing their performance data, player contributions, tactical success, and head-to-head records vs elite European clubs.
- üß† Historical win rate against past UCL winners
- üìä Average xG, possession, goal difference across matches
- ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical formations with the highest win %
- üë• Star player stats compared to UCL contender benchmarks
## Background
### Tools I used
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî data loading, cleaning, and querying
- **pgAdmin** ‚Äî managing database views
- **Excel** (supporting analysis)
-  ## The Analysis
-  Multiple tables were joined and queried to uncover performance trends, tactical impact, and likelihood of success based on past UCL-winning team metrics.
## üóÇÔ∏è Data Schema
- `match_results`: Match-level data (result, xG, possession, goals, etc.)
- `player_stats`: Individual player metrics (xG, tackles, passing, rating)
- `ucl_contenders`: Stats of other Champions League contenders
-`tactics`: Formation usage and match results
- `performance_against_ucl_winners`: Record vs elite clubs like Real Madrid, Man City

### üí° Insights:

- Tech campaigns earn the most referral traffic out of any other type of campaign.

##  What I Learned ‚Äî Tottenham UCL Prediction (SQL Project)
- Match-level data (xG, xGA, possession, pass %, etc.) gives deep insight into team consistency and quality of play ‚Äî far beyond the win/loss result.
- Creating multiple relational tables (e.g., match_results, player_stats, tactics, ucl_contenders) helped simulate a scouting-style model.
- Aggregating team performance against past UCL winners was especially helpful in understanding competitiveness at a European level.
- I reinforced my skills in joining data, conditionally counting (using CASE WHEN), and calculating percentage-based metrics to evaluate performance.
- Using the ROUND(), SUM(), and COUNT() functions allowed for easy creation of stat tables and summary performance dashboards.
### üßæ Conclusion
By analyzing Tottenham‚Äôs recent performances alongside UCL winner trends and competitor stats, I built a SQL-driven model to assess their chances in the upcoming UEFA Champions League. This analytical approach blends historical context, player performance, tactical insight, and advanced metrics ‚Äî providing fans or analysts with a realistic, data-based prediction of success potential.
- This project shows how data analysts can use SQL to analyze PR campaigns across multiple marketing KPIs. By ranking campaigns by conversion efficiency, media reach, and backlinks-to-conversion ratio, I was able to provide a clearer picture of which campaigns  were most effective. These insights could support future campaign ideations, budget allocation, and optimization strategies for future UK-based digital PR efforts.
